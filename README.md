Hello world,

This was my first attempt at making a working angular app, a cool little todo
list.  My friend Mason and I decided to attempt to make the list interactive
by making buttons to move the tasks to the proper list when either completed (or not completed).  Although there is a lot to learn, Angular does seem to make things easy.

This is a functioning app.

In the future, I would like to add some more functionality and style to this
little project so it makes a better first impression.  My own list of things to do grows by the hour so I may actually use my own app someday.
